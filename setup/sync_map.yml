# =================================================================================
# Mapping between paths in local and remote servers for deployment (transfer).
#
# Format of the mapping for directories and files:
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#     - source: path/to/source/directory/
#       destination: path/to/destination/directory/
#     - source: path/to/source/file.ext
#       destination: path/to/destination/file.ext
#     - source: path/to/source/file.ext
#       destination: path/to/destination/directory/
#     - source: path/to/source/file.ext
#       destination: path/to/destination/directory/new_name.ext
#
# Rules:
# - Paths are *relative* to the *root* directory of the workspace in the respective servers.
# - To copy the *contents* of a directory, add a trailing slash to the source path.
# - To copy the *directory itself*, do not add a trailing slash to the source path.
# - To copy a single file, either specify its name in the destination (e.g. for renaming) or only
#   specify its destination directory with a trailing slash.
