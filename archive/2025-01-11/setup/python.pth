# ==================================================================================================
# Paths to be added to the Python path `PYTHONPATH`
#
# Additional paths will be searched for Python packages when importing modules.
# The packages will be available in the Python environment of the workspace, and thus can be
# imported in any Python script, module or notebook.
#
# Notes
# -----
# Each path has to be specified on a separate line.
# If relative paths are used, they are resolved relative to the workspace root directory.
# If they contain environment variables, they should be defined in the central `path.env` file.
#
# Warning
# -------
# After a path is added to the `PYTHONPATH`, a sub-directory within it is considered as a package if
# it contains an `__init__.py` file.
#
# Example
# -------
# .. code-block:: plaintext
#
#     path/to/add
#     ├── package_1/
#     │   ├── __init__.py
#     │   └── subpackage_a/
#     │       └── __init__.py
#     └── package_2/
#         └── subpackage_b
#
# After adding "one/path/to/add" to the `PYTHONPATH`:
#
# - `package_1` and `package_1.subpackage_a` are available for import.
# - `package_2` is not available for import as it does not contain an `__init__.py` file.
