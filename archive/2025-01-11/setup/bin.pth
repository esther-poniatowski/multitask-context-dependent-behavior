# ==================================================================================================
# Paths to be added to the system `PATH`
#
# Additional paths will be searched for executables when running commands in the terminal.
#
# Notes
# -----
# Each path has to be specified on a separate line.
# If relative paths are used, they are resolved relative to the workspace root directory.
# If they contain environment variables, they should be defined in the central `path.env` file.
#
# Warning
# -------
# Scripts added to the `PATH` are run as a command by their name, therefore they should not have the
# same name as an existing system command.
# Scripts added to the `PATH` should have the executable permission set.
# After a path is added to the `PATH`, only the scripts at the *top level* of the directory are
# available. Sub-directories are not searched for executables.
#
# Example
# -------
# .. code-block:: plaintext
#
#     path/to/add
#     ├── script_1
#     └── subdirectory/
#         └── script_2
#
# After adding "one/path/to/add" to the `PATH`:
#
# - `script_1` is available for execution.
# - `script_2` is not available for execution as it is located in a sub-directory.
