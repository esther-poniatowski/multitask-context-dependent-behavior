Prerequisites for Using the Project
-----------------------------------

1. Navigate to the Project Directory named ``multitask-context-dependent-behavior``

.. code-block:: bash

    cd path/to/multitask-context-dependent-behavior


2. Activate the Conda Environment

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate mtcdb


Once the environment is activated, the project's scripts and modules can be run safely.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    python scripts/<script_name>.py

3. After the end of a session, deactivate the environment to return to the base environment

.. code-block:: bash

    conda deactivate

.. note::
   Operating *within* the project directory ensures that relative paths in codes and configuration files correctly point to other resources within the project.
   Activating the virtual environment dedicated to the project ensures that any Python execution use the Python interpreter and dependencies required for the project.
